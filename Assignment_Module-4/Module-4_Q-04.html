    <h2>Q-04 : Name a few CSS style components.</h2>
    <p><b>Ans :</b></p>
    <p>-> CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</p>

<p>-> We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>

<p>1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</p>
<p>2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</p>
<p>3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</p>
<p>4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</p>
<p>5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</p>
